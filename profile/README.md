## INTRODUCTION

TYPO3 [Headless](https://github.com/TYPO3-Headless/headless) allows you to change how your TYPO3-powered backend behaves on the frontend. In a traditional approach, the backend is responsible for rendering. With the headless extension, TYPO3 only provides data in form of JSON files and works as API for your application, while the frontend part consumes the JSON API and renders content using Nuxt framework.

What difference does it make?
The extension makes it possible to separate the frontend application from the backend. Thanks to it content is accessible via API for any device.
